# Advanced React Patterns

## Teaching method

1. Collaborative learning environment & pair programming.
   - Rooms with small groups
   - Work together, discuss, help each other.
2. We try to foster critical thinking.
   - ⬆️ Discovery ⬇️ Instruction
3. We don’t explain everything you need to know before the exercise:
   - Learn by doing (and teaching ;)
   - The exercise is meant to help you build a mental model

## Advanced React patterns

This workshop doesn't define "advanced" as doing complicated things that you haven't done or seen before, but:

1. Understanding how things work, not just "doing".
2. Using those things properly and when necessary.
3. Making complicated things simple, not the other way around.
